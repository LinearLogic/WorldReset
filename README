#<>---{WorldReset v1.1}---<>

Presenting the world's first standalone map reset plugin! When you restart your server, your world folder is automatically deleted and replaced with a copy of the world folder stored in the WorldReset plugin directory!

NOTE: In order for this plugin to work, you have to /stop then start the server. A simple /reload will not work, and will likely cause the server to crash.

###Changelog (1.1 --> 1.2)
- Added a config handler class
- Added support for multiple worlds
- Added config node for resets (world only resets if the node is set to true)
- Added '/resetworld' command (sets the aforementioned node to true and - if typed again - stops the server)
- Repackaged everything
###Changelog (1.0 --> 1.1)
- Added a checker so that the world deletion and import processes are not initialized unless there is a folder named 'world' in the WorldReset plugin directory.
