#<>---{WorldReset v2.0.1}---<>

Presenting the world's first standalone map reset plugin! When you restart your server, your world folders are
automatically deleted and replaced with a copy of the world folders stored in the WorldReset plugin directory! You can
also specify worlds to be deleted and regenerated with random seeds, perfect for mining worlds that change the location
of diamonds, emeralds, etc. every time the server restarts.

**NOTE:** In order for world resets to work, you have to /stop then start the server. A simple /reload will not work,
and will potentially cause the server to crash.

##Setup
Drop WorldReset.jar into your server's plugin directory and start and stop the server. Place any world folders you want
to reset to in ../plugins/WorldReset/backups, making sure that the backup folders have the same names as actual world
folders in your server directory. Modify the config.yml as needed and you're good to go!
