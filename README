#<>---{WorldReset v1.1}---<>

Presenting the world's first standalone map reset plugin! When you restart your server, your world folder is automatically deleted and replaced with a copy of the world folder stored in the WorldReset plugin directory!

NOTE: In order for this plugin to work, you have to /stop then start the server. A simple /reload will not work, and will likely cause the server to crash.

###Changelog (1.0 --> 1.1)
- Added a checker so that the world deletion and import processes are not initialized unless there is a folder named 'world' in the WorldReset plugin directory.
